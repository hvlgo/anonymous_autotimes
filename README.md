# AutoTimes

The repo is the official implementation for the paper: AutoTimes: Autoregressive Time Series Forecasters via Large Language Models. It currently includes code implementations for the following tasks:

> **[Time Series Forecasting](./scripts/time_series_forecasting/)**: We repurpose large language models as out-of-box time series forecasters on benchmarks including long-term and short-term forecasting.

> **[Zero-shot Forecasting](./scripts/zero_shot_forecasting/)**: Large models exhibiting remarkable zero-shot capability are beneficial for data-scarce applications. AutoTimes takes advantage of this and demonstrates good performance without training samples.

> **[In-context Forecasting](./scripts/in_context_forecasting/)**: We propose in-context forecasting for the first time, where instructions in time series itself are available to further enhance forecasting.

> **[Generality on Large Language Models](scripts/method_generality)**: AutoTimes can be easily applied to various kinds of large language models, demonstrating generality and proper scaling behavior.
